# creelreview

## Overview

`creelreview` is a R package for performing rigorous, standardized data quality assurance and quality control checks (QAQC) on freshwater recreational creel data. It is used during in-season monitoring of ongoing fisheries and for critical review of complete datasets during the post-season. This work supports [CreelEstimates](https://github.com/wdfw-fp/CreelEstimates).

## Installation

`creelreview` can be installed from GitHub with the `devtools` package. As GitHub is a source code repository, this requires the installation of [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

``` r
devtools::install_github("wdfw-fp/creelreview")
```
